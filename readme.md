# Hello, Class!<sup>TM</sup>

Hello Class will be a web application that allows educators to host class sessions that allow them post questions for their students to answer. This will be directly aimed at educators teaching programming. Educators can post coding questions, and the students submit code as a solution. This will compile, run, check the output of the student's code, and give the results to the educator.
